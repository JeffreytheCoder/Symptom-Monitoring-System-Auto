<!-- ABOUT -->
## üê± About

**UCLA CAT** ([Covid-symptom-survey](https://uclasurveys.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_aeH9BFhYVjkYTsO) Auto-filling Tool) is an automation software that frees UCLA bruins from the annoying daily routine of manually filling out the Covid Symptom Survey to show our healthy status.

One click of UCLA CAT completes the survey for you as a healthy status for today. You can schedule the UCLA CAT to run every day at midnight, so you always get a pretty green screen wherever you go.

![demo](https://github.com/MubaiHua/Symptom-Monitoring-System-Auto/images/demo.gif)

Disclaimer: This tool is only for people who have no Covid symptoms, and only serves as a convenient way to fill survey to show a healthy status from day to day. If you have any Covid symptoms, please do not and stop using this tool.
